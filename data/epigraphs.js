    epigraph: `A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 5th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special carethat you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fiteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.`,

    epigraph: `You have read that Muad'Dib had no playmates his own age on Caladan. The dangers were too great. But Muad'Dib did have wonderful companion-teachers. There was Gurney Halleck, the troubador-warrior. You will sing some of Gurney's sons as you read along in this book. There was Thufir Hawat, the old Mentat Master of Assassins, who struck fear even in into the heart of the Padishah Emperor. There were Duncan Idaho, the SwordMaster of the Ginaz; Dr. Wellington Yueh, a name black in treachery but bright in knowlege; the Lady Jessica, who guided her son in the Bene Gesserit Way, and -- of  course -- the Duke Leto, whose qualities as a father have been long overlooked.`,

    epigraph: `How do we approach the study of Muad'Dib's father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there-- a man snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?`,
